# FGForAll
This is a replica of the FGForAll, in Python, built for convenience.
The code was AI generated use it at your own risk!

Enjoy! Feel free to not buy me coffee as you can enjoy the coffee yourself! Use the code as you like but don't take credit!

The steps you need to do:
1. Download the [dlss-fg](https://github.com/Nukem9/dlssg-to-fsr3/) mod from the Nexus mods [website](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/738).
2. Extract the downloaded mode to directory `dlss-fg`, all files from the universal mod should be placed under this folder.
3. Download the `FGForAll.py` source code, use `python3` to run the code. (Install `pyqt` using pip3 or brew first)
4. Install/Remove the mod for any game you have! It searches for Steam/Epic Games automatically but 
you can also insert the game directory that includes the nvidia dll files. (Drag and drop any file from the relevant directory)
5. Install will create a backup of the dll file that is to be replaced inside a `bak` folder, as you remove the mod,
the backup files will be restored to the original game folder and all the mod files will be deleted.
6. **Beware**: I am not an expert on which games require which folder to be modded, so feel free to just use your own instincts and
use drag & drop feature instead. (Otherwise, it needs to be hardcoded for each game that behaves differently.)
